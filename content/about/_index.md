title = "This is me..."
+++

Software engineer, Linux user, bookworm, and programming enthusiast. I have been
voiding warranties since age 9 and writing my own software since age 11, and I’m
not about to stop anytime soon.

I'm deeply fascinated by hard problems of all kinds, from large-scale
distributed systems to highly constrained embedded and real-time systems. I care
about open source software, censorship resistance, data distribution and
integrity at scale, cybersecurity, and safe systems programming.

I develop largely in **Rust** and **TypeScript** these days and manage my own
infrastructure using **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, **Google Cloud Platform**, and
**ArgoCD**.

I have experience with **C**, **C++ (98 and modern)**, **C#**, **HTML/CSS/JS**,
**Java**, **Nix**, **Processing**, **SQL**, **VBA (Microsoft Access)**, **Visual
Basic**, and [**ladder logic**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_logic).

I regulate my body temperature by pumping liquid coolant though my veins, and my
eyes directly take 24-pin DVI from my video card.

If all that sounds interesting to you, take a look at
[my portfolio](@/projects/_index.md) and [résumé](/resume.pdf). You can also
find me on any of the services below. I'm usually down for a cup of coffee!
