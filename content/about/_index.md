Engineer, tinkerer, bookworm, tech enthusiast.

I'm based in the United States, currently working as a software engineer at
Disney Streaming. I am the founder of the [Amethyst](https://github.com/amethyst)
game engine project and a couple other popular open source projects. I also have
7+ years of work experience at companies large and small; you can get the full
story on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebkalderon).

I'm fascinated by hard problems of all kinds, including (but not limited to)
distributed and decentralized systems, embedded systems programming, computer
graphics, programming language and compiler design, and cryptography. I care
about free and open source software, healthy and thriving communities, and
leaving this world in a better state than I found it.

If any of that sounds interesting to you, check out
[my portfolio](@/projects/_index.md) and [résumé](/resume.pdf). You can also
contact me via one of the communication channels below. I'm usually down for a
cup of coffee! :coffee:
